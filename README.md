# HSL Colour Game

A color guessing game. Users select the square that corresponds with the target HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) value to win the game.

I chose to use HSL values instead of RGB (red, green, blue) as I find it a more intuitive format for people to understand. An excellent explanation on why HSL values are more intuitive is given [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26059228/css-hsl-or-rgba-colors/43795837).

Used technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript.
